The website is a project assignment from theodinproject.com (TOP), which is used to link to a few food recipes.
In this project, I will demonstrate the HTML skills I've learned from TOP, which is:
- Building an HTML boilerplate
- Working with paragraphs, and modification of text, such as italic and bold.
- Making a list
- Inserting links and images
