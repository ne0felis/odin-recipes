        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            If you're looking for the best French toast recipe on the internet, you've come to the right place. This tender, 
            fluffy, and indulgent recipe comes together quickly and easily with just five ingredients you already have on hand. 
            It's easier than you think to make restaurant-quality French toast in the comfort of your own kitchen – you just 
            need a skillet, a few staple ingredients, and a good recipe. That's where we come in!
        </p>

        <p>
            The best breads for French toast are brioche, sourdough, French bread, or challah. These varieties are dense and sturdy 
            enough to handle total saturation in the wet, milky, egg custard without falling apart. However, in a pinch, any thick-sliced 
            white bread will do. French toast is traditionally made with day-old slices because they absorb the eggy mixture better than 
            fresh ones (and this method prevents waste – it's a win-win). Of course, a slightly stale loaf is certainly not a requirement. 
            If you only have fresh bread on hand, that'll work just fine.
