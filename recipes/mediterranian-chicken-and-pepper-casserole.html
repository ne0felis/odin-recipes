            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 skinless, boneless chicken breast, cut into strips</li>
            <li>1 small yellow onion, diced</li>
            <li>1 small yellow bell pepper, diced</li>
            <li>1 small red bell pepper, diced</li>
            <li>8 cherry tomatoes</li>
            <li>¼ cup Italian green olives</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon grated lemon zest</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>¼ cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
            <li>¼ cup grated Grana Padano cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Cook pasta until flexible 
                but not soft, about 5 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a stovetop- and oven-safe casserole dish over medium-high 
                heat. Cook and stir chicken strips until browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Add onion, 
                bell peppers, cherry tomatoes, olives, thyme, lemon zest, and pepper flakes. 
                Cook and stir until the onions have begun to look translucent, about 5 minutes. 
                Remove from heat. Stir in the half-cooked pasta.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle Pecorino Romano and Grana Padano over the pasta mixture.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and the cheeses have melted and browned, 
                about 15 minutes. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
